        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Allow anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit or
          credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Online payments have become increasingly popular over the past
          several years, as people take advantage of advances in security,
          reliability, and device hardware. The coronavirus pandemic in 2020-2021
          accelerated this trend with the rise of social distancing and
          contactless payments. Now, more than ever, consumers need easy ways to
          send and receive money without requiring a physical presence.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>PlutoPay — a financial services app — aims to address this market by
          enabling users to complete easy electronic funds transfers. The app
          also allows users to review their transaction history, add contacts to
          transfer money to or from, and set up savings goals.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h1 style="color:#ff5757">DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
        <p>My design process is cyclical and iterative. At a high level, it's
          split into four phases: research, design, testing, and finalization.
          Here's a process diagram; note that the Test phase and Design phase
          lead into each other. As I get feedback from users, product people,
          and engineers, I incorporate that into the next iteration of the
          design, until I reach a final state for the product.</p>

        </picture>
        <p>In this project, these four phases consisted of smaller pieces of work, which I will present in more detail in the rest of this case study. The high-level summary of the contents of each phase for the PlutoPay project is specified below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research: Competitive analysis, user interviews, personas</li>
          <li>Design: low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wireframes and interactive
            prototypes, design language and style guide</li>
          <li>Test: card sorting, usability study, preference test</li>
          <li>Finalize: final interactive prototype, asset collection for hand-off</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My role in this project included all of the above steps -- I was the
          sole designer for PlutoPay, which was given as a brief by the
          CareerFoundry UX Immersion Course.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h1>IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM SPACE</h1>
        <p>My first step was to identify areas that users may struggle with. I thought about experiences my friends and I have had with online payments and transactions, and used that to compile problem ideas:
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Payments may require prior bank authorization.</li>
          <li>Users may succumb to fraudulent transaction requests.</li>
          <li>User data is stored insecurely, allowing malicious actors access.</li>
          <li>Users find visiting physical locations such as banks and stores inconvenient (or dangerous, during the COVID-19 pandemic).</li>
          <li>Users feel confused or overwhelmed by using cryptocurrency.</li>
          <li>Users feel wary of entering credit card or bank information in sites they are unfamiliar with to complete a transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, I distilled my brainstorming into a formal problem statement:</p>
        <h3>People who want to complete non-physical financial transactions need a way to perform these transactions safely, securely, and efficiently because they want to exchange funds to make electronic purchases.</h3>
        <p>What could solve this problem? PlutoPay: a responsive web app that...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>uses the same security protocols as banks</li>
          <li>saves users’ financial info for quick access</li>
          <li>can make quick cross-platform payments</li>
          <li>detects fraudulent transactions and alerts users</li>
          <li>is transparent about security & data protection</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="colored">
        <div class="container">
          <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>Before diving in and defining a solution, I wanted to better understand existing products that served this market. Online payments have been in use for several years, and money transfer apps have also been increasing in popularity as more and more people need to send money to or receive money from friends and family, and even businesses.</p>
          <p>My focus while analyzing competitors was to answer this question:</p>

          <h3>How can PlutoPay differentiate itself from solutions already on the market, and what are those solutions missing vs. doing well?</h3>
          <p>I wanted to be thorough and gain a clear understanding of existing solutions and the niches they serve, so I investigated seven products: Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, Google Pay, WeChat Pay, and Privacy.com.</p>

          <p>Within this group, Venmo, PayPal, and CashApp primarily focused on the individual-to-individual transfer market, but included various other features such as cryptocurrency and investing support. Apple Pay, Google Pay, and WeChat Pay targeted the individual-to-business side of the spectrum, with Apple Pay also offering users their own credit card (which Venmo also has). Privacy.com also targets the individual-to-business market, but in a different way; this service allows users to create multiple digital debit or credit cards, which they can assign to a specific shopping site, in order to prevent payment platforms and merchants from selling user purchasing data to third parties. A summary of key points for each of these competing products is provided here:</p>

          <picture>
            <source srcset="../img/plutopay/600px/PlutoPay_Competitor_Summary.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="../img/plutopay/1200px/PlutoPay_Competitor_Summary.png" alt="Key points from competitive analysis">
          </picture>

          <p>
            Since all of these competing platforms could be categorized into one
            of two groups as defined earlier, I selected two of these products to
            do a deep-dive on: PayPal (representative of the individual-to-
            individual segment) and Apple Pay (representative of the individual-to
            -business segment). This deep-dive included a review of the products'
            key objectives and market advantage, as well as a SWOT analysis and
            full UX profile.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I had a clear understanding of the existing products in the
            electronic financial transfer market, I was able to summarize my
            findings into four key findings relating to business impacts for
            PlutoPay:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Target Audience <br/>
              Younger, tech-savvy users like college students or young professionals
              are a good customer base for early testing.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Competition<br/>
                Popular products that provide digital wallet & online funds transfer
                services.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Risks<br/>
                Major competitors are tech giants with significant resources and
                marketing reach.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Opportunities<br/>
                It's possible to capitalize on features that existing solutions lack
                or are weak in, like cryptocurrency trading and privacy.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given this, I wanted to learn more about prospective users' thoughts
            on investing, cryptocurrency, and data privacy, and also whether users
            felt that these existing problems had any major flaws that may present
            an opportunity for PlutoPay. I worked these topics into my user
            interview questionnaire, and then solicited help from my personal
            network to find participants.</p>

          <h2>User Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            I was able to conduct user interviews with three participants, which
            helped me gain a better understanding of user needs and previous
            experience with financial service products. All interviews were
            conducted virtually, over Zoom. My goals for these interviews was to
            determine the prior experience and comfort level that users might have
            with online financial transactions, what pain points they ran into in
            this area, and to explore user interest in additional features such as
            investing and cryptocurrency, as mentioned earlier. The core takeaways
            from the interviews are presented below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Competitor Usage<br/>
                Venmo is easy to use and serves its purpose of allowing users to
                send money to friends and family. Interviewees who have used
                Venmo commented that it would be hard to improve on the product.
                Interviewees also thought highly of PayPal, but mentioned that
                there are features that are platform dependent (e.g. certain
                functions can only be done on a desktop, not mobile devices).</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Privacy & Security<br/>
                All respondents agreed that they tend to base their trust level
                of a financial service on the reputation of the company providing
                the service. If there is a reputable brand name associated with
                the service, they are more likely to trust it. Users do not look
                for specific security or privacy protocols in financial apps.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Cryptocurrency<br/>
                Two out of three respondents were unfamiliar with cryptocurrency
                and as a result, did not feel comfortable using it to pay for
                goods or services. The third interviewee has actively traded and
                mined cryptocurrency in the past, but pointed out that it would
                be difficult for mainstream users to access cryptocurrency in a
                way that maintained their privacy.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Overall Experience<br/>
                No interviewees had major problems with the current solutions
                they use for exchanging money with friends and family. Two of
                them said Venmo and CashApp do a good job of filling that niche,
                while the third said the same for her bank’s app. However, two
                users did mention having frustration around data entry,
                remembering passwords, and making new accounts on new sites for
                purchases.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            To draw out further insights from the feedback I got from the user
            interviews, I reviewed my notes and used affinity mapping to condense
            key points. Through this process, I identified several main themes
            that connected participants' sentiments from the user interviews:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users do not have major problems with existing solutions and think
                it would be difficult to greatly improve the current experience
                provided by competitors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users feel online shopping is more convenient than in-person
                shopping, and tend to shop online frequently. This behavior
                increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic as well.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users want all app features to have cross-platform support for
                flexibility and ease of use.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Data entry when shopping online is a big pain point; users want a
                standardized, cross-platform, one-click solution for online
                shopping.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users are concerned about sharing sensitive personal information,
                such as banking details, with a relatively unknown service like
                PlutoPay.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Although users are concerned about their data being shared to
                third parties without their consent or getting leaked in security
                breaches, they do not look for any specific privacy or security
                features and instead rely on brand recognition and popularity as
                measures of trustworthiness.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Users do not have much experience with cryptocurrency or investing,
                and aren't interested in having those features available because
                of a steeper learning curve and higher barrier to entry.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Synthesis and Direction</h2>
          <p>
            Based on customer interviews, it seemed that there was little interest
            in using the app to trade stocks or cryptocurrencies, and that users
            were satisfied overall with the solutions they were currently using.
            The biggest pain point for almost all of the participants was having
            to do data entry whenever they complete an online purchase (e.g.
            re-typing card information, emails, etc.) and not having cross-platform
            support for this need across multiple devices. I thought this was a
            novel use case, and became interested in finding a solution to this
            problem, as it seemed to be a promising direction for PlutoPay.
            However, the solution that was most likely to be most effective was a
            browser extension -- not a responsive web app -- and so that idea was
            out of scope for this project, as per the brief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combining requirements from the brief with my research, I created a more
            comprehensive list of features to include in PlutoPay that would satisfy
            the brief. Then I wrote user stories describing how users would want to
            interact with the product and why the feature would help them. This left
            me with 30+ user stories, some of which were epics and needed to be broken
            down further. Here are some samples from that list:
          </p>
          <h3>
            As a PlutoPay novice just setting up my account, I want to see
            introductory information about the app, so that I have a better
            understanding of how to get started using it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
            As a goal-oriented user, I want to know how well I am doing in meeting
            my financial goals when I open the app, so that I can plan my expenses
            accordingly.
          <br/>
          <br/>
            As a security-conscious user, I want to verify my identity and the
            identity of the other party involved in a transaction when I send or
            receive money, so that I make sure that funds are moving to the right
            individual or business.
          </h3>

          <h2>Persona Development</h2>
          <p>
            Armed with copious amounts of background information from user
            interviews and my competitive analysis, I then created a primary
            persona for PlutoPay, "Claire". Claire is a university student in a
            mid-sized city, who frequently needs to send money to or request money
            from friends. She feels frustrated when she has to chase friends who
            owe her money down, and wants to be able to keep a record of payments
            she sent and received so that she can keep tabs on who she owes vs.
            who owes her. However, she is reluctant to share her data with apps
            she doesn't trust.

        <h2>Task Flows</h2>
        <p>
          Once I created the personas and identified Claire as the primary
          persona for PlutoPay, I was able to imagine what sort of tasks she
          would like to complete in PlutoPay, and then design user flows for
          those tasks. Shown below are two of the flows I created, showing how a
          user of PlutoPay would complete a new funds transfer and check their
          transaction history.

        <p>
          After creating user flow diagrams for the persona’s tasks, I had an
          idea of the overall information architecture of the app. To formalize
          it, I conducted a card sort to determine how users grouped concepts
          and whether any updates to the sitemap were necessary. Based on the
          card sort feedback, I developed the app's sitemap.

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          I then sketched out some low-fidelity wireframes to illustrate what
          PlutoPay’s main screens might look like along Claire’s journey.

        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Mockup</h2>
        <p>
          To clean the sketches up a bit before showing them to users, I
          converted them into mid-fidelity designs using Figma, and made the
          prototype interactive. I also fleshed out more screens as part of the
          prototype, following the task flows I created earlier. This was so my
          usability study participants later on would have a clear idea of how
          PlutoPay would eventually function when live, and to define details
          like spacing & position before going into high-fidelity wireframes.

          <h1>TEST</h1>
          <h2>Usability Studies</h2>
          <p>
            At this point, I could finally test the interactive prototype with real
            users. My goals for the usability testing phase were (1) to better
            understand user interactions with the app and (2) to assess where the
            design was confusing or non-functional. I interviewed six participants
            over Zoom, and recorded the sessions. During the usability test, I
            provided five direct tasks, and asked users to rank the difficulty of each
            one after completion. I also collected their general feedback about the
            app and the tasks as they proceeded through the test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most calls went smoothly, except for the last one; the participant had
            internet issues that caused their audio to fade in and out frequently.
            This made collecting data a bit difficult for the last session, as I
            also had to screenshare the prototype and have them tell me what to
            click on, rather than them being able to directly interact with the
            prototype by themselves. Although the situation was technically
            challenging compared to the other interviews, changing the format
            allowed it to proceed well enough, but not ideally.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of insights, most participants struggled with the task to
            select multiple contacts in the contact menu, so I determined that
            task flow in the prototype needed work to improve intuitiveness. Some
            participants also questioned the need for collecting email addresses
            for contacts, saying that they were unlikely to know this information
            for their friends. The top three key usability problems from this
            exercise are presented below, in order from highest to lowest
            priority, along with my plan for fixing each issue.

        <h1>DESIGN</h1>
        <h2>High-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
        <p>
          I updated the prototype based on the feedback from the round of usability testing, then worked on making high-fidelity screens for an upgrade to the interactive prototype. Once done, I had the high-fidelity prototype peer reviewed by other UX students to get further input on the app’s functionality and design, and made further changes as necessary. Frequently, peer review feedback conflicted with data I had gathered from user interviews and usability testing; in those cases, I prioritized user needs over design commentary, as the end goal is to develop a product that solves user problems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Generally most of the feedback I was getting was positive, and mostly focused on small details. I took this as a positive sign since no one seemed to have any major points of confusion with the app functionality; there were no huge usability flaws in this design. As a result, the overall structure of the app did not change too much over the iterations of increasing fidelity. Many testers were pleased by the minimalist visuals and clean look in I used in PlutoPay's high-fidelity prototype.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Language</h2>
        <p>During this phase, I also established a formal design language. Previously when creating the mid-fidelity prototype, I had already included consistent spacing and implemented standard typography throughout the app, but the full style guide encompassed iconography and the color palette as well. I also took stock of all the assets and UI elements in my design, to make it easy to hand off to an engineer later on.

        <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
        <p>
        As part of updating the high-fidelity prototype for the final version, I also make some changes to make the app more accessible to a wider range of users. A few of these changes are discussed in more detail below.
        </p>

        <div class="card content-highlight">
          <div style="flex:3; padding-left:1em">
            <h3>GRAPH COLOR CODING</h3>
            <p>
              Yellow originally was used to show when a contribution is below the daily goal, but there was no other cue to indicate to users whether a day’s savings contribution was over or under the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid relying solely on color as a means of conveying that information, I added a line on the graph to show where the daily contribution goal is, so users can see which entries are above or below the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also darkened the font on the dollar values for each bar in the graph, and made them all the same color to improve readability and consistency.

            <h3>FORMS & PLACEHOLDERS</h3>
            <p>
              Although I was already following accessibility recommendations to use clear boundaries to denote text input fields in forms, I hadn’t included placeholders, so I added them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also improved the visual separation between the text input fields and the background color by using a very light version of the brand purple as a fill on the text inputs; this color combination passes the WCAG AA contrast check (below).
            </p>
            <p>
              These changes provide extra information to users about what they should enter in the fields, and serve as a more distinct visual delineation between what is interactive and what is not.

            <h3>LARGE TEXT MODE</h3>
            <p>
              Because the body and header fonts may be too small for various user groups, I added an option to increase the font size for user comfort. This makes the app content easier to read for individuals who may have vision impairments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because I want users to have flexibility and control over their experience, in the functional app, I would recommend implementing a slider in Settings, which is used to increase the font size. This is instead of a simple toggle between large and small. This customizability ensures each user’s viewing experience is optimized to them.

        <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
        <h2>Market + Product Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The final version of my design for PlutoPay satisfied all the requirements from the project brief. However, I felt that the resulting product was not novel, lacked differentiation from existing competitors, and did not fully align with user needs that I discovered during user interviews. Why? During my research, I heard from multiple users about an unaddressed pain point regarding data entry when completing online transactions. Users wanted a one-click payment platform that worked across multiple devices and browsers -- I felt the optimal solution to this problem likely would be a browser extension, and not a web application. However, as this was a course project, I was limited by the course requirements, which specified that the end result must be a mobile-friendly, responsive web app; unfortunately this conflicted with information I was receiving from user interviews.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this had been a "real" project for a client or company, at this point I would have made a recommendation that a pivot to the product direction may be in order, assuming that pivoting was an option at such an early stage in the product development process. I would have presented the pain points from my research as support. I also would have pointed out that the major players in the electronic-transfers market are well-established tech giants, meaning that breaking into this market would be tough without significant innovation to disrupt the space. As users did not have strong problems with existing solutions, and even said themselves they felt it would be hard to improve on the products they already use, launching PlutoPay as a pseudo-Venmo web application would not (in my opinion) meet the level of innovation required to compete with products such as Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, and so forth. Of course, the final decision on which way to proceed would be up to the client.
        </p>
        <h2>Recommended Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Assuming that the PlutoPay project were to continue as is, I would want to spend more time researching how to incorporate individual-to-business transactions more fully in the app, as I suspect this is one area of possible differentiation from existing competitors. From an implementation standpoint, it likely would be challenging, as business owners would need incentives to adopt the technology and use it to accept payments. Furthermore, Apple Pay, Google Pay, WeChat Pay and Samsung Pay all already operate in this space with contactless payments via NFC; it is unlikely that PlutoPay would do anything different from a technology standpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of improving the app itself, I would recommend adding more animations to interactions to make the overall feel more sleek and engaging, and experiment with more customization options (ex. themes or dark mode) so that users could satisfy their visual preferences. Given that the app is in a "final" state, I would also recommend another round of usability testing to work out any remaining bugs with the design. As PlutoPay is a web application, scaling the design up to tablet, laptop, and computer monitor sizes would also be the logical next step.
