        OVERVIEW
        Objective
        Allow anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit or credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store.

        Background
        Online payments have become increasingly popular over the past several years, as people take advantage of advances in security, reliability, and device hardware. The coronavirus pandemic in 2020-2021 accelerated this trend with the rise of social distancing and contactless payments. Now, more than ever, consumers need easy ways to send and receive money without requiring a physical presence.

        Solution
        PlutoPay — a financial services app — aims to address this market by enabling users to complete easy electronic funds transfers. The app also allows users to review their transaction history, add contacts to transfer money to or from, and set up savings goals.
      </div>
      DESIGN PROCESS
      My design process is cyclical and iterative. At a high level, it's split into four phases: research, design, testing, and finalization. Here's a process diagram; note that the Test phase and Design phase lead into each other. As I get feedback from users, product people, and engineers, I incorporate that into the next iteration of the design, until I reach a final state for the product.


      In this project, these four phases consisted of smaller pieces of work, which I will present in more detail in the rest of this case study. The high-level summary of the contents of each phase for the PlutoPay project is specified below:

      Research: Competitive analysis, user interviews, personas

      Design: low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes, design language and style guide

      Test: card sorting, usability study, preference test

      Finalize: final interactive prototype, asset collection for hand-off

      My role in this project included all of the above steps -- I was the sole designer for PlutoPay, which was given as a brief by the CareerFoundry UX Immersion Course.
      IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM SPACE
      My first step was to identify areas that users may struggle with. I thought about experiences my friends and I have had with online payments and transactions, and used that to compile problem ideas:

      Payments may require prior bank authorization.

      Users may succumb to fraudulent transaction requests.

      User data is stored insecurely, allowing malicious actors access.

      Users find visiting physical locations such as banks and stores inconvenient (or dangerous, during the COVID-19 pandemic).

      Users feel confused or overwhelmed by using cryptocurrency.

      Users feel wary of entering credit card or bank information in sites they are unfamiliar with to complete a transaction.

      Next, I distilled my brainstorming into a formal problem statement:

      People who want to complete non-physical financial transactions need a way to perform these transactions safely, securely, and efficiently because they want to exchange funds to make electronic purchases.
      What could solve this problem? PlutoPay: a responsive web app that...

      uses the same security protocols as banks

      saves users’ financial info for quick access

      can make quick cross-platform payments

      detects fraudulent transactions and alerts users

      is transparent about security & data protection

      RESEARCH
      Competitive Analysis
      Before diving in and defining a solution, I wanted to better understand existing products that served this market. Online payments have been in use for several years, and money transfer apps have also been increasing in popularity as more and more people need to send money to or receive money from friends and family, and even businesses.

      My focus while analyzing competitors was to answer this question:

      How can PlutoPay differentiate itself from solutions already on the market, and what are those solutions missing vs. doing well?
      I wanted to be thorough and gain a clear understanding of existing solutions and the niches they serve, so I investigated seven products: Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, Google Pay, WeChat Pay, and Privacy.com.

      Within this group, Venmo, PayPal, and CashApp primarily focused on the individual-to-individual transfer market, but included various other features such as cryptocurrency and investing support. Apple Pay, Google Pay, and WeChat Pay targeted the individual-to-business side of the spectrum, with Apple Pay also offering users their own credit card (which Venmo also has). Privacy.com also targets the individual-to-business market, but in a different way; this service allows users to create multiple digital debit or credit cards, which they can assign to a specific shopping site, in order to prevent payment platforms and merchants from selling user purchasing data to third parties. A summary of key points for each of these competing products is provided here:


      Since all of these competing platforms could be categorized into one of two groups as defined earlier, I selected two of these products to do a deep-dive on: PayPal (representative of the individual-to-individual segment) and Apple Pay (representative of the individual-to-business segment). This deep-dive included a review of the products' key objectives and market advantage, as well as a SWOT analysis and full UX profile.

      Once I had a clear understanding of the existing products in the electronic financial transfer market, I was able to summarize my findings into four key findings relating to business impacts for PlutoPay:

      Target Audience
      Younger, tech-savvy users like college students or young professionals are a good customer base for early testing.

      Competition
      Popular products that provide digital wallet & online funds transfer services.

      Risks
      Major competitors are tech giants with significant resources and marketing reach.

      Opportunities
      It's possible to capitalize on features that existing solutions lack or are weak in, like cryptocurrency trading and privacy.

      Given this, I wanted to learn more about prospective users' thoughts on investing, cryptocurrency, and data privacy, and also whether users felt that these existing problems had any major flaws that may present an opportunity for PlutoPay. I worked these topics into my user interview questionnaire, and then solicited help from my personal network to find participants.

      User Interviews
      I was able to conduct user interviews with three participants, which helped me gain a better understanding of user needs and previous experience with financial service products. All interviews were conducted virtually, over Zoom. My goals for these interviews was to determine the prior experience and comfort level that users might have with online financial transactions, what pain points they ran into in this area, and to explore user interest in additional features such as investing and cryptocurrency, as mentioned earlier. The core takeaways from the interviews are presented below:

      Competitor Usage
      Venmo is easy to use and serves its purpose of allowing users to send money to friends and family. Interviewees who have used Venmo commented that it would be hard to improve on the product.
      Interviewees also thought highly of PayPal, but mentioned that there are features that are platform dependent (e.g. certain functions can only be done on a desktop, not mobile devices).

      Privacy & Security
      All respondents agreed that they tend to base their trust level of a financial service on the reputation of the company providing the service. If there is a reputable brand name associated with the service, they are more likely to trust it. Users do not look for specific security or privacy protocols in financial apps.

      Cryptocurrency
      Two out of three respondents were unfamiliar with cryptocurrency and as a result, did not feel comfortable using it to pay for goods or services. The third interviewee has actively traded and mined cryptocurrency in the past, but pointed out that it would be difficult for mainstream users to access cryptocurrency in a way that maintained their privacy.

      Overall Experience
      No interviewees had major problems with the current solutions they use for exchanging money with friends and family. Two of them said Venmo and CashApp do a good job of filling that niche, while the third said the same for her bank’s app. However, two users did mention having frustration around data entry, remembering passwords, and making new accounts on new sites for purchases.

      To draw out further insights from the feedback I got from the user interviews, I reviewed my notes and used affinity mapping to condense key points. Through this process, I identified several main themes that connected participants' sentiments from the user interviews:

      Users do not have major problems with existing solutions and think it would be difficult to greatly improve the current experience provided by competitors.

      Users feel online shopping is more convenient than in-person shopping, and tend to shop online frequently. This behavior increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic as well.

      Users want all app features to have cross-platform support for flexibility and ease of use.

      Data entry when shopping online is a big pain point; users want a standardized, cross-platform, one-click solution for online shopping.

      Users are concerned about sharing sensitive personal information, such as banking details, with a relatively unknown service like PlutoPay.

      Although users are concerned about their data being shared to third parties without their consent or getting leaked in security breaches, they do not look for any specific privacy or security features and instead rely on brand recognition and popularity as measures of trustworthiness.

      Users do not have much experience with cryptocurrency or investing, and aren't interested in having those features available because of a steeper learning curve and higher barrier to entry.

      Synthesis and Direction
      Based on customer interviews, it seemed that there was little interest in using the app to trade stocks or cryptocurrencies, and that users were satisfied overall with the solutions they were currently using. The biggest pain point for almost all of the participants was having to do data entry whenever they complete an online purchase (e.g. re-typing card information, emails, etc.) and not having cross-platform support for this need across multiple devices. I thought this was a novel use case, and became interested in finding a solution to this problem, as it seemed to be a promising direction for PlutoPay. However, the solution that was most likely to be most effective was a browser extension -- not a responsive web app -- and so that idea was out of scope for this project, as per the brief.

      Combining requirements from the brief with my research, I created a more comprehensive list of features to include in PlutoPay that would satisfy the brief. Then I wrote user stories describing how users would want to interact with the product and why the feature would help them. This left me with 30+ user stories, some of which were epics and needed to be broken down further. Here are some samples from that list:

      As a PlutoPay novice just setting up my account, I want to see introductory information about the app, so that I have a better understanding of how to get started using it.

      As a goal-oriented user, I want to know how well I am doing in meeting my financial goals when I open the app, so that I can plan my expenses accordingly.

      As a security-conscious user, I want to verify my identity and the identity of the other party involved in a transaction when I send or receive money, so that I make sure that funds are moving to the right individual or business.
      Persona Development
      Armed with copious amounts of background information from user interviews and my competitive analysis, I then created a primary persona for PlutoPay, "Claire". Claire is a university student in a mid-sized city, who frequently needs to send money to or request money from friends. She feels frustrated when she has to chase friends who owe her money down, and wants to be able to keep a record of payments she sent and received so that she can keep tabs on who she owes vs. who owes her. However, she is reluctant to share her data with apps she doesn't trust.


      DESIGN
      Task Flows
      Once I created the personas and identified Claire as the primary persona for PlutoPay, I was able to imagine what sort of tasks she would like to complete in PlutoPay, and then design user flows for those tasks. Shown below are two of the flows I created, showing how a user of PlutoPay would complete a new funds transfer and check their transaction history.


      The user flow above goes through the process of setting up and completing a new funds transfer in PlutoPay. It starts at the very beginning step of opening the app, and ends once the transfer is confirmed.


      This user flow demonstrates the steps a user would take to view historical details of one of their past transactions. It starts with launching the app, and ends with locating the desired data.

      After creating user flow diagrams for the persona’s tasks, I had an idea of the overall information architecture of the app. To formalize it, I conducted a card sort to determine how users grouped concepts and whether any updates to the sitemap were necessary. Based on the card sort feedback, I developed the app's sitemap.


      Low-Fidelity Sketches
      I then sketched out some low-fidelity wireframes to illustrate what PlutoPay’s main screens might look like along Claire’s journey.


      Mid-Fidelity Mockup
      To clean the sketches up a bit before showing them to users, I converted them into mid-fidelity designs using Figma, and made the prototype interactive. I also fleshed out more screens as part of the prototype, following the task flows I created earlier. This was so my usability study participants later on would have a clear idea of how PlutoPay would eventually function when live, and to define details like spacing & position before going into high-fidelity wireframes.


      TEST
      Usability Studies
      At this point, I could finally test the interactive prototype with real users. My goals for the usability testing phase were (1) to better understand user interactions with the app and (2) to assess where the design was confusing or non-functional. I interviewed six participants over Zoom, and recorded the sessions. During the usability test, I provided five direct tasks, and asked users to rank the difficulty of each one after completion. I also collected their general feedback about the app and the tasks as they proceeded through the test.

      Most calls went smoothly, except for the last one; the participant had internet issues that caused their audio to fade in and out frequently. This made collecting data a bit difficult for the last session, as I also had to screenshare the prototype and have them tell me what to click on, rather than them being able to directly interact with the prototype by themselves. Although the situation was technically challenging compared to the other interviews, changing the format allowed it to proceed well enough, but not ideally.

      In terms of insights, most participants struggled with the task to select multiple contacts in the contact menu, so I determined that task flow in the prototype needed work to improve intuitiveness. Some participants also questioned the need for collecting email addresses for contacts, saying that they were unlikely to know this information for their friends. The top three key usability problems from this exercise are presented below, in order from highest to lowest priority, along with my plan for fixing each issue.

      Trouble multi-selecting contacts
      High Priority
      The Problem
      83% of participants had trouble finding how to select multiple contacts at a time. While some commented that the functionality was intuitive, they had caveats that a user would need to know the feature existed first before they could actually find and use it.

      The Solution
      ‍Include more visual cues that the multi-select feature exists.

      (Note that users can't press and hold a mobile prototype on desktop, despite that being the user's instinct, which caused some problems in testing).


      Purpose of contact groups unclear
      Medium Priority
      The Problem
      67% of users were confused or unsure of what the purpose of the Groups feature is, with nearly half of them saying it seemed redundant or that they wouldn’t use such a feature.

      The Solution
      Revise Groups functionality; potentially replace it with automatically generated “Recents” list based on who the user interacted with last.


      "Is there a way to skip onboarding?"
      Low Priority
      The Problem
      33% of participants wanted to skip onboarding or mentioned that they usually skip onboarding when using new apps. This may also be a helpful feature if someone is making a new account, but has used the app before, or is just in a hurry to begin using it in an exploratory way.

      The Solution
      Add a skip button to the onboarding flow.


      DESIGN
      High-Fidelity Mockups
      I updated the prototype based on the feedback from the round of usability testing, then worked on making high-fidelity screens for an upgrade to the interactive prototype. Once done, I had the high-fidelity prototype peer reviewed by other UX students to get further input on the app’s functionality and design, and made further changes as necessary. Frequently, peer review feedback conflicted with data I had gathered from user interviews and usability testing; in those cases, I prioritized user needs over design commentary, as the end goal is to develop a product that solves user problems.

      Generally most of the feedback I was getting was positive, and mostly focused on small details. I took this as a positive sign since no one seemed to have any major points of confusion with the app functionality; there were no huge usability flaws in this design. As a result, the overall structure of the app did not change too much over the iterations of increasing fidelity. Many testers were pleased by the minimalist visuals and clean look in I used in PlutoPay's high-fidelity prototype.


      Design Language
      During this phase, I also established a formal design language. Previously when creating the mid-fidelity prototype, I had already included consistent spacing and implemented standard typography throughout the app, but the full style guide encompassed iconography and the color palette as well. I also took stock of all the assets and UI elements in my design, to make it easy to hand off to an engineer later on.


      Accessibility Considerations
      As part of updating the high-fidelity prototype for the final version, I also make some changes to make the app more accessible to a wider range of users. A few of these changes are discussed in more detail below.

      GRAPH COLOR CODING
      Yellow originally was used to show when a contribution is below the daily goal, but there was no other cue to indicate to users whether a day’s savings contribution was over or under the goal.

      To avoid relying solely on color as a means of conveying that information, I added a line on the graph to show where the daily contribution goal is, so users can see which entries are above or below the goal.

      I also darkened the font on the dollar values for each bar in the graph, and made them all the same color to improve readability and consistency.


      FORMS & PLACEHOLDERS
      Although I was already following accessibility recommendations to use clear boundaries to denote text input fields in forms, I hadn’t included placeholders, so I added them.

      I also improved the visual separation between the text input fields and the background color by using a very light version of the brand purple as a fill on the text inputs; this color combination passes the WCAG AA contrast check (below).

      These changes provide extra information to users about what they should enter in the fields, and serve as a more distinct visual delineation between what is interactive and what is not.


      LARGE TEXT MODE
      Because the body and header fonts may be too small for various user groups, I added an option to increase the font size for user comfort. This makes the app content easier to read for individuals who may have vision impairments.

      Because I want users to have flexibility and control over their experience, in the functional app, I would recommend implementing a slider in Settings, which is used to increase the font size. This is instead of a simple toggle between large and small. This customizability ensures each user’s viewing experience is optimized to them.


      FINALIZE
      Clickable Prototype & End Product
      With all that, I finished the final design for PlutoPay. You can access the interactive prototype below, or watch my walkthrough video to dive deeper into each of the features that I implemented.



      REFLECTION
      Market + Product Analysis
      The final version of my design for PlutoPay satisfied all the requirements from the project brief. However, I felt that the resulting product was not novel, lacked differentiation from existing competitors, and did not fully align with user needs that I discovered during user interviews. Why? During my research, I heard from multiple users about an unaddressed pain point regarding data entry when completing online transactions. Users wanted a one-click payment platform that worked across multiple devices and browsers -- I felt the optimal solution to this problem likely would be a browser extension, and not a web application. However, as this was a course project, I was limited by the course requirements, which specified that the end result must be a mobile-friendly, responsive web app; unfortunately this conflicted with information I was receiving from user interviews.

      If this had been a "real" project for a client or company, at this point I would have made a recommendation that a pivot to the product direction may be in order, assuming that pivoting was an option at such an early stage in the product development process. I would have presented the pain points from my research as support. I also would have pointed out that the major players in the electronic-transfers market are well-established tech giants, meaning that breaking into this market would be tough without significant innovation to disrupt the space. As users did not have strong problems with existing solutions, and even said themselves they felt it would be hard to improve on the products they already use, launching PlutoPay as a pseudo-Venmo web application would not (in my opinion) meet the level of innovation required to compete with products such as Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, and so forth. Of course, the final decision on which way to proceed would be up to the client.

      Recommended Next Steps
      Assuming that the PlutoPay project were to continue as is, I would want to spend more time researching how to incorporate individual-to-business transactions more fully in the app, as I suspect this is one area of possible differentiation from existing competitors. From an implementation standpoint, it likely would be challenging, as business owners would need incentives to adopt the technology and use it to accept payments. Furthermore, Apple Pay, Google Pay, WeChat Pay and Samsung Pay all already operate in this space with contactless payments via NFC; it is unlikely that PlutoPay would do anything different from a technology standpoint.

      In terms of improving the app itself, I would recommend adding more animations to interactions to make the overall feel more sleek and engaging, and experiment with more customization options (ex. themes or dark mode) so that users could satisfy their visual preferences. Given that the app is in a "final" state, I would also recommend another round of usability testing to work out any remaining bugs with the design. As PlutoPay is a web application, scaling the design up to tablet, laptop, and computer monitor sizes would also be the logical next step.
